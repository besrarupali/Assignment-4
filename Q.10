Decimal to Binary:
Step 1. Divide the integer by 2, while noting the quotient and remainder.

Step 2. Then, divide the quotient again by 2, and record the 3rd quotient and remainder.

Step 3. Like this, keep dividing each successive quotient by 2 until you get a quotient of zero.

Step 4. After this, just write all the remainders in reverse order to get the binary representation of the integer.

Binary to Decimal:
Step 1. To convert a binary integer to decimal, start by adding the left-most digit to 0.

Step 2. Next, multiply this by 2, and add the next digit in your number (from left to right) to this product.

Step 3. Continue this process until there are no more digits left.
